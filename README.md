<h1 align=center>Garthchat Utilities</h1>
This project contains various "meta-utilities" for Garthchat. This includes source code generation tools, linting programs, and other stuff to help bootstrap and facilitate the development of Garthchat.

# Contribution
**You may submit contributions to this project**, and are free to ask to be a collaborator/contributor to avoid having to fork the repo to make contributions! Through contributing, however, you grant me, (Gartham), a perpetual, irrevocable, unmodifiable, limitless, royalty-free copyright license to copy, modify, reproduce, export, sublicense, display, distribute, or otherwise do with as I see fit, the contributions you make and derivatives of such contributions. 

Without effect to the meaning and effects of the text heretofore, note that there are two primary reasons for such granting of license:
 1. I need permission to use the code and other works in this repository, either directly for Garthchat or indirectly for Garthchat. (Direct usage could be including some code from this repo in Garthchat itself, and indirect usage could be executing a tool to generate advertisements to help promote Garthchat).
 2. If this project grows past or away from Garthchat, I'll need the ability to extend or modify the license granted for the contents of the repository as I see fit (possibly to people or entities other than myself), as well as be able to re- or sub-license  the contents of the repository, as I see fit.

Also, please note that the acceptance of contributions to this project does not guarantee that such contributions will become, in any way, a part of Garthchat, or that they will be used by or in the making of Garthchat. Additionally, you must not _require_ any attribution to your contributions. 
Without effect to the meaning and effects of text heretofore, note that this **DOES NOT** mean you will **not** get credit for your work, it just means that you may not, for example, require that derivations of your code explicitly reproduce your name, contact-info, and an image of your face, to the user, as requirements of attribution may make the usage of contributions, which subject to such requirements, infeasible in Garthchat or the future endeavors of this project.

# Other
Although there are plans to make this repository open source, this repository is **not currently open source**.

Although I will try to check over every contribution for errors, errors may still get past me. Additionally, since this project is open to the public for contributions, many contributors may contribute while learning to code or develop programs. To facilitate contributions and such educational experiences and to assure that the contributors of this project can contribute without regard to errors, contributors to this project may not be held liable, in part, or in whole, resulting either directly or indirectly from *any* usage of this repository by Gartham (me) or anyone else, either in part, or in whole. There is absolutely no warranty offered for the works contributed by any contributor, including Gartham, to Gartham or anyone else.

This prevents whoever uses this code, including me (Gartham), from legally being able to hold a contributor liable for any errors in the contributor's code, in addition to offering other protections to contributors.
