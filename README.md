<h1 align=center>Garthchat Utilities</h1>

**Welcome to Garthchat Utilities!** This project contains various "meta-utilities" for Garthchat. This includes source code generation tools, linting programs, and other stuff to help bootstrap and facilitate the development of Garthchat.

### Language
Most of the code in this repo will probably end up being in Java, unless someone other than me contributes in another language (or another language is really needed), but if you'd like to add something that's not written in Java, that's totally fine!

### Management
This project is owned and managed by [Gartham](https://github.com/Gartham). This is meant to be a fun, collaborative, community project that members of my community can contribute to. I'm looking forward to programming with friends and hopefully teaching some how to fluently and effectively program.

### Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you're looking for something to do, feel free to check out the [Issues](https://github.com/Gartham/garthchat-utilities/issues) tab and fix a bug, augment a feature, or add something that's listed there. You can also make issues of your own if you think something's broken or if you think some tool would be cool and useful!

You're also welcome to simply fork the repository and start adding on your own contributions, without bothering with the issues tab. Once you're ready, pull request your changes into the main repo, and it'll get reviewed/edited/accepted.

You can also talk with me on Discord if you need anything: `Gartham#7960` :-)

### Contribution
**You may submit contributions to this project**, and are free to ask to be a collaborator/contributor to avoid having to fork the repo to make contributions! Through contributing, however, you grant me, (Gartham), a perpetual, irrevocable, unmodifiable, limitless, royalty-free copyright license to copy, modify, reproduce, export, sublicense, display, distribute, or otherwise do with as I see fit, the contributions you make and derivatives of such contributions.

There are two important things that those provisions allow:
 1. I need permission to use the code and other works in this repository, either directly for Garthchat or indirectly for Garthchat. (Direct usage could be including some code from this repo in Garthchat itself, and indirect usage could be executing a tool to generate advertisements to help promote Garthchat).
 2. If this project grows past or away from Garthchat, I'll need the ability to extend or modify the license granted for the contents of the repository as I see fit (possibly to people or entities other than myself), as well as be able to re- or sub-license  the contents of the repository, as I see fit.

Also, please note that the acceptance of contributions to this project does not guarantee that such contributions will become, in any way, a part of Garthchat, or that they will be used by or in the making of Garthchat. Additionally, you must not require any attribution that I deem excessive. (An example of this is requiring that any apps which use your code print out your contact info + a profile icon of your face.)

### Miscellaneous
Although there are plans to make this repository open source, this repository is **not currently open source**. There are some legal shenaningans, like liability, that I feel may be problematic if this project were made open source from the get-go.

Although I will try to check over every contribution for errors, errors may still get past me. Additionally, since this project is open to the public for contributions, many contributors may contribute while learning to code or develop programs. To facilitate contributions and such educational experiences and to assure that the contributors of this project can contribute without regard to errors, contributors to this project may not be held liable, in part, or in whole, resulting either directly or indirectly from *any* usage of this repository by Gartham (me) or anyone else, either in part, or in whole. There is absolutely no warranty offered for the works contributed by any contributor, including Gartham, to Gartham or anyone else.

This prevents whoever uses this code, including me (Gartham), from legally being able to hold a contributor liable for any errors in the contributor's code, in addition to offering other protections to contributors.

Lastly, note that the rules and provisions herein may change at any time, and that only I or those I explicit permit may change them, upon which, the contributors and contributions must follow such new provisions.

I think this is permissive enough. :-)
